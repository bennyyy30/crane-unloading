### Description

This project compares the performance between an exhaustive algorithm
versus a dynamic programming algorithm through a problem where a truck is
to travel through a grid (Only going south and east). This grid is either
a valid path where the truck can travel through, a building where the truck
cannot travel through, and crane where the truck must collect. The goal of this
program is to determine which path collects the most cranes scattered throughout
this graph. To solve, this we can use an exhaustive algorithm taking 2^n time,
or we can use a dynamic programming algorithm taking n^3 time.
